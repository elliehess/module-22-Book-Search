## Installation

npm i  
npm build  
npm run develop  

## Usage 

Upon loading the search engine, you will be presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button. If you click on the Search for Books menu option, there is an input field to search for books and a submit button.
If you are not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, several search results will appear, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site. By clicking on the Login/Signup menu option, a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up.
If the toggle is set to Signup, you will see inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button. If the toggle is set to Login, you will see two inputs for an email address and a password and login button. You may enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button and a user account is created and you are logged in to the site. If you enter your account’s email address and password and click on the login button, the modal closes and you are logged in. After logging in, the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout. Enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button and you will be presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to your account. If you click on the Save button on a book, that book’s information is saved to your account. You can click on the option to your saved books and will see all of the books saved to your account. There is also a button to remove a book from the account. If you click on the Remove button on a book, that book is deleted from the saved books list. By clicking on the Logout button, you will be logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.
